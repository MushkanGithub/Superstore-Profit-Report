## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps to analyze profit for superstores or any small firms based on different criteria. It helps a retailer to view the beautiful report ready for analyzing the profit gained. Used different visuals to view the profit in different angles. Made use of a pie chart to analyze profit by category, 2 donought charts to analyze profit by segment and region. Used Bar chart to analyze profit by sub-category and line chart to analyze profit by year and quarter. To illustrate sub-category, sales and region , made use of a table. Used slicer to filter out the whole report based on the state and used 3 cards to show total sales, qunatity and profit earned. In this way, a shopkeeper can have a full report to estimate profit earned.

### Steps followed :-

- Step 1 : Load your superstore/shop data into Power BI Desktop.
- Step 2 : Get data from Excel and finally load it as data is already cleaned and if not, can transform data.
- Step 3: Changed the background colour to black.
- Step 4 : Added heading, a pie chart, 2 donought charts, a line chart, a bar chart, a slicer, 3 cards and a table to analyze profit in different angles.
- Step 5 : Finally, I created a Power BI service account and published the Superstore Profit Report online.
- Step 6 : Pinned a live report page to a dashboard and now a retailer can make use of it to analyze the profit earned in his/her work.
